                <strong>Laboratory 4</strong><br>
                <strong>Consuming Microservices</strong>
                <p>
                    During fourth laboratory students should get familiar with basic concepts of consuming
                    microservices using JavaScript language. Task requires creating new projects which will
                    be communicating with previously developed gateway application.
                </p>
                <p>The following tasks must be completed:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        View (HTML page and JavaScript code) presenting list of all categories. View
                        should allow for removing selected category. It is enough to display single userfriendly
                        value representing category. (1 point)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        View for adding new category (form). View should be accessible from categories list
                        view. (1 point)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        View for editing existing category (pre-populated form). View should be accessible
                        from categories list view. View form should be populated with original values.
                        Category should be determined by the query parameter. (1 point)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        View with category details and elements list. View should present all details
                        considering selected category and list of all elements from that category. It is
                        enough to display single user-friendly value representing element. Category should
                        be determined by the query parameter. View should allow for removing selected
                        element. (1 point)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        View for adding new element (form). View should be accessible from category
                        details view. Category of the new element should be determined by the query
                        parameter. (1 point)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        View for editing existing element (pre-populated form). View should be accessible
                        from category details view. View should be populated with original values. Category
                        and element should be determined by the query parameters. (1 point)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        View with element details. View should present all details considering selected
                        element. Category and element should be determined by the query parameters.
                        (1 point)
